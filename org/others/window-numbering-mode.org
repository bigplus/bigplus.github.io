#+TITLE: WINDOW-NUMBERING-MODE

* window-numbering.el

first, read the article
http://blog.binchen.org/posts/moving-focus-and-buffer-between-emacs-window.html

window-numbering.el is the best. It uses hot key "M-NUM" to switch window (for example, "M-3" to select window with number 3). So I can press only one key to switch window. Besides, it has some extra features like "M-0" to jump to the minbuffer.

Here is my configuration of window-numbering.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC 

(require 'window-numbering)
;; highlight the window number in pink color
(custom-set-faces '(window-numbering-face ((t (:foreground "DeepPink" :underline "DeepPink" :weight bold)))))
(window-numbering-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

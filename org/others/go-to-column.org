#+TITLE: Go to Column

Almost every Emacs user knows that M-g M-g and M-g g (both bound to go-to-line) will take him to the line of his choosing (provided he knows the number of the target line, of course).

Surprisingly few Emacs users know that there is a similar way to jump to a column by its number - M-g TAB (bound to move-to-column). Interactively you cannot jump past the end of the line you’re currently on, but you can always cook your own version of the command to get around that limitation:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(defun go-to-column (column)
  (interactive "nColumn: ")
  (move-to-column column t))
#+END_SRC









Let’s bind that to some keycombo:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(global-set-key (kbd "M-g M-c") 'go-to-column)
#+END_SRC

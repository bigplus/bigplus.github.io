#+TITLE: Install htop on Mac OS X

* manual install
But this command isn’t part of Mac OS X.

Sure, you can follow the various tutorials out there, to install git, then grab the htop source code and install it yourself. Or you can be a lazy nerd and grab the binary that I’ve compiled and install it.

Copy and paste the following commands into a terminal window:

curl -O http://themainframe.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/htop.zip
unzip htop.zip
sudo mv htop /bin
rm htop.zip
You will need to enter your password for the ‘sudo’ line above.

* brew install htop
brew install htop
